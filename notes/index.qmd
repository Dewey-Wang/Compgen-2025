# Welcome to Genomic Insights

This website is my personal note compilation, based on the **Compgen2025 -- Module 1: AI-assisted Data Analysis** course. The course content primarily covers **statistical foundations and machine learning applications in genomics**. If you are interested in the application of **ML in bioinformatics**, you may find this resource helpful!

The course consists of a series of **theoretical lectures and programming exercises**, with a primary focus on analysis using **R**. However, in my notes, I will mainly cover **fundamental theoretical concepts** and explain **the reasoning behind each step** rather than focusing on code implementation.

# **About the Course**

The **Compgen2025** course is organized by the **Max DelbrÃ¼ck Center** at the **Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology**. It is designed for **computational biology PhD students**, **experimental biologists**, and **medical scientists** who want to enhance their skills in data analysis.

## **Course Modules:**

-   **Module 1**: AI-assisted data analysis (This note only cover this module right now)

-   **Module 2**: Spatial omics data analysis

-   **Module 3**: Multi-omics data integration
